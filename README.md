# mini-stardew

This is a tiny test game made in GameMaker Studio 2.

You can:
* Move a ring around with the arrow keys to highlight grass or dirt tiles
* Watch a plant grow on some of the tiles
* Pluck the plant with the spacebar once it is finished growing

I am testing the following:
1. Host a GameMaker game on GitHub Pages [wazawoo.github.io/mini-stardew](https://wazawoo.github.io/mini-stardew/)
2. Allow downloads of macOS and Windows builds via this website

See you at Ludum Dare 46!
